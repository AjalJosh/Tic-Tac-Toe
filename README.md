 Tic Tac Toe game in Java is a program that allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where each player takes turns placing their symbol (either X or O) in an empty square. The winner is the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game implementation involves creating a GUI interface, implementing user input, and checking for a winning condition. Additionally, the program may include features such as a scoreboard, an option to restart the game, and AI opponents.
